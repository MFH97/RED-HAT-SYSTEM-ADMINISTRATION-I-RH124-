# Chapter 3: Managing Files from the Command Line

## Goals
Copy, move, create, delete, and organize files while
working from the Bash shell.

## Objectives

- Describe how Linux organizes files, and the
purposes of various directories in the file
system hierarchy.
- Specify the location of files relative to the
current working directory and by absolute
location, determine and change your working
directory, and list the contents of directories.
- Create, copy, move, and remove files and
directories.
- Make multiple file names reference the same
file using hard links and symbolic (or "soft")
links.
- Efficiently run commands affecting many files
by using pattern matching features of the Bash
shell.
