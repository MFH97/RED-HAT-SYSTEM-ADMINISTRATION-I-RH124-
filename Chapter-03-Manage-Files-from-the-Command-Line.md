# Chapter 3: Managing Files from the Command Line

## Goals
Copy, move, create, delete, and organize files while
working from the Bash shell.

## Objectives

- Describe how Linux organizes files, and the
purposes of various directories in the file
system hierarchy.
- Specify the location of files relative to the
current working directory and by absolute
location, determine and change your working
directory, and list the contents of directories.
- Create, copy, move, and remove files and
directories.
- Make multiple file names reference the same
file using hard links and symbolic (or "soft")
links.
- Efficiently run commands affecting many files
by using pattern matching features of the Bash
shell.

#file-system hierarchy = single inverted tree of directories  
This tree is inverted because the root of the
tree is said to be at the top of the hierarchy, and the branches of directories and subdirectories
stretch below the root
